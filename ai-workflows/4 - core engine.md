# Workflow 4 — Core Engine

The parser and matcher architecture are now stable.

Implement the fundamental capabilities of the regex engine.

The objective is to create a stable foundation upon which all remaining features will build.

## Features

Implement:

- literal character matching
- escaped literals
- concatenation
- wildcard (`.`)
- parser validation
- basic AST validation
- basic matcher execution

## Dependencies

None.

This workflow establishes the foundation for every subsequent feature.

## Development Process

For every capability:

1. Read the Wiki specification.
2. Verify current behavior.
3. Add failing tests.
4. Implement the minimum correct solution.
5. Ensure all tests pass.
6. Update documentation.

## Testing

Cover:

- successful matches
- failed matches
- empty patterns
- empty strings
- escaping
- parser validation
- malformed expressions
- regression cases

## Deliverables

- Stable core matcher
- Passing tests
- Updated documentation
